Documentaton :  <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdeModulePkg/Universal/PCD/Dxe/Pcd.inf"> MdeModulePkg/Universal/PCD/Dxe/Pcd.inf  </a> 

Purpose

- Establishes platform common definitions 
- Build-time/Run-time aspects 
- Binary Editing Capabilities 

Goals

- Simplify porting 
- Easy to associate with a module or platform

## Slide 5 @title[PCD Syntax review]
### <p align="center">PCD Syntax  - REVIEW 
PCDs can be located anywhere within the Workspace even though a different package will use those PCDs for a given project</span>

Note:

- The Platform configuration database is generated by the build process parsing the build description files that define and specify PCD entries.

- What we see on this slide is how the PCD data is being used in various levels of the build description files

- First we have the DEC file – this Defines a list of PCD tokens that modules can use. 
 	It Defines the PCD entries that will exist under the GUID for that  package, the PCD restriction, valid types for the PCD, and a default value for the PCD. There is a whole syntax and how to define a PCD in the DEC file.

- Next we have PCB entries in the INF file- and this Defines the usage of PCD tokens by the module.
	It Defines what PCD entries are being used within the module, the PCD restriction (or DYNAMIC for none), and a Optional default value for the PCD within this module only.

- Next is the DSC file – This is at the Platform level and describes the contents of the build for a specific platform. 
	PCD entries are assigned values and types for the platform build. You would define a value here to be used by that platform. The value could be different when it is defined in the DEC file but the value in the DSC would be the final value . And They Cannot conflict with established restrictions.

- Not on this slide but also there is the FDF build description File – and this file would have flash layout related values

## Slide 7 @title[EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab ]
<b>EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab  </b></p>

First Setup for Building EDK II for Emulator, See <a href="https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_C_01_Platform_Build_Win_Emulator_Lab_guide.md#slide-10--titlelab-1--build-emulator-section">Lab Setup for Emulator </a>

Locate and Open <br>
`edk2/MdeModulePkg/Application/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.c`

Notice the PCD values
<br>
<br>
<br>
Build Emulation <br>
Then Run HelloWorld at the Shell command interface 

Note:

- So the steps for getting the source code, hopefully everyone did this prior to this training because it does take some time to download.
- So here are the steps:

- First create a directory, and for our example case we are using the directory "~src/Fw/edk2-ws"  Linux or

"C:\Fw\edk2-ws" Windows

## Slide 8 @title[EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab steps]
<p align="left"><b>EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab  </b></p>

Open a VS  Command Prompt and type: `cd C:\FW\edk2-ws` then 
```shell

  C:/FW/edk2-ws> Setenv.bat
  C:/FW/edk2-ws> cd edk2
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> edksetup.bat

```
Build the EmulatorPkg for Windows X64 (run WinHost.exe from Build/EmulatorX64/ . . ./X64 )


```shell
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> Build –D ADD_SHELL_STRING
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> RunEmulator.bat
```
At the UEFI Shell prompt
```shell
Shell> Helloworld
UEFI Hello World!
Shell> 
```

<font color="green">How can we force the HelloWorld application to print out 3 times ?</font>


Note:
RunEmulator.bat will run WinHost.exe from Build/EmulatorX64/DEBUG_TAG/X64

<a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/MdeModulePkg/Application/HelloWorld"> MdeModulePkg/Application/HelloWorld </a>


Note:

First let's look at the source code for the HellowWorld Application

## Slide 10 @title[EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab code]
### <b>EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab  </b> 
<span style="font-size:01.0em" >Source: <font color="green">Helloworld.c</font></span>

```C++
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
UefiMain (
  IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,
  IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable
  )
{
	UINT32 Index;
	Index = 0;
  // Three PCD type (FeatureFlag, UINT32 
  // and String) are used as the sample.
  if (FeaturePcdGet (PcdHelloWorldPrintEnable)) {
  	for (Index = 0; Index < PcdGet32   (PcdHelloWorldPrintTimes); Index ++) {
  	  
  	  // Use UefiLib Print API to print
      // string to UEFI console
  	  
    	Print ((CHAR16*)PcdGetPtr (PcdHelloWorldPrintString));
    }
  }

  return EFI_SUCCESS;
}
```

Note:


Source from Helloworld.c

## Slide 11 @title[EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab solution]
### <b>EDK II HelloWorld  App  Solution </b> 


Note:

- look in file: `C:\fw\edk2\MdeModulePkg\MdeModulePkg.Dec`

- This PCD defines the print string.
-  This PCD is a sample to explain String typed PCD usage.
-  `gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldPrintString|L"UEFI Hello World!\n"|VOID*|0x40000004`

Solution:
1. Edit the file C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2/EmulatorPkg/EmulatorPkg.dsc
  - After the section [PcdsFixedAtBuild], add the new line :  
  - `[PcdsFixedAtBuild]`
  - `gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldPrintTimes|3`

2. Re-Build – Cd to FW/edk2 dir 
  - `bash$ build -D ADD_SHELL_STRING`
  -

## SLide 12 @title[EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab solution 02]
### <b>EDK II HelloWorld  App  Solution </b> 


Note:

3. RunEmulator.bat

4. At the Shell prompt
```
 Shell> Helloworld
 UEFI Hello World!
 UEFI Hello World!
 UEFI Hello World!
 Shell> 
```
5. Exit with Reset at the shell

- How can we change the string of the HelloWorld application?
- Also see  ~src/edk2/MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.Dec
